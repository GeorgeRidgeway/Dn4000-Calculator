# Dn4000-Calculator

Over time, the stellar population within an individual galaxy evolves. This evolution can be detected in the galaxies spectrum. With our spectroscopic data, we can calculate the Dn4000 spectral index. Dn4000 is a spectral ratio of the red side (4000Å to 4100Å) to the blue side (3850Å to 3950Å) of a galaxy’s spectrum (Balogh et al. 1999). This ratio is centered around 4000Å due to the spectral break at that wavelength from metal absorption lines (Kim et al. 2022). Dn4000 is defined as

$$
D_{n4000} = \frac{\overline{f^R}}{\overline{f^B}} = \frac{(\lambda_2^B - \lambda_1^B)\int_{\lambda_1^R}^{\lambda_2^R}f_{\nu}d\lambda}{(\lambda_2^R - \lambda_1^R)\int_{\lambda_1^B}^{\lambda_2^B}f_{\nu}d\lambda}
$$

where *f <sup>R</sup>* and *f <sup>B</sup>* are the average flux densities in the red (4000Å to 4100Å) and blue (3850Å to 3950Å) region of spectrum, respectively.
